# Minishell - A 42 School Project
## "As beautiful as a shell"

```
This project is about creating a simple shell.
Yes, your own little bash.
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.
```
~ The subject for this project

Minishell is a (very) simplified copy of bash.
Among the things that bash does that msh doesn't, the most important are:
- Logical operators such as && and ||
- Wildcards (*)
- Escape characters (\)
- Semicolons


Msh is written in accordance with 42 School's coding norm, see here:
